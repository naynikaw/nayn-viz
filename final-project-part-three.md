# Final Project — Part III

# The final data story

This story looks at how Product Management rose in popularity, how the interview-prep and bootcamp market grew around it, and how the role shifted again when AI arrived. I used simple charts, clear writing, and a three-act structure to explain these changes. The story follows Aisha, a fictional student whose experience reflects the path many people took when trying to break into PM. Her story gives readers a steady thread to follow while the data shows the larger patterns that shaped her choices.


# Changes made since Part II
After Part II, I made several adjustments based on instructor feedback and user interviews. The biggest change was strengthening the narrative between charts. Earlier drafts read like a sequence of visuals without enough context. I added short explanations before and after each chart, and I made sure every chart answered a clear question in the story. I also added more transitions so the three acts flow in a natural way.

Act III needed more work, so I expanded the section on how AI shifted the expectations of Product Management. I clarified what changed after 2022 and showed how new titles, posting counts, and salary patterns support the shift toward AI-focused roles. I also improved the writing to make it more direct and less stylized.

I added a call to action, which was missing in the previous draft. The CTA helps readers understand what they can do next, depending on whether they want the traditional PM path or the AI-specific path. I made the CTA specific for CMU students because they are my intended audience.

I also added clearer chart labels, simple annotations, and source lines under each figure. These changes help with transparency and make the visuals easier to understand. I kept the overall writing style consistent and removed vague or hype-filled phrasing.


## The audience
My main audience is CMU graduate students in professional programs such as MISM, MSPM, MSISPM, and MBA. Most of the students I interviewed fall into these groups. They are exploring careers in tech and want clear, straightforward information. Their feedback helped me see where I needed to slow down, where transitions were thin, and where the story needed more grounding.

These students responded best to simple explanations, clean charts, and practical takeaways. They did not want abstract storytelling or dramatic language. They wanted to know what the data means for them. This shaped the tone of the writing and the structure of the final story. I used Aisha as an anchor because it helps readers map their own decisions to her path. I wrote the CTA with CMU students in mind and added details that relate to their course options and career choices.


## Final design decisions
I kept the story in three acts because the PM career arc fits this structure well: the rise, the saturation, and the shift. This made it easier to place charts where they support the narrative. I chose simple, static charts instead of interactive ones to keep the webpage light, clear, and easy to maintain. Each chart uses a consistent color theme to reduce visual noise.

I used short sections and plain sentences to make the story easy to read. I avoided technical language unless it was relevant. I added a human anchor because it makes the data more relatable. These decisions helped make the final version feel cleaner and more focused.

One thing that stood out during this process was how much difference good transitions make. A clear sentence before and after a chart often mattered more than the chart itself. I also learned how important it is to choose a specific audience. It makes decision-making easier and keeps the story from drifting.

## AI acknowledgements
I used AI tools (ChatGPT and Anti-Gravity) to help with:
- drafting text,
- revising narrative sections,
- refining labels and captions,
- and generating boilerplate code.

I wrote, edited, and decided on all final content. AI tools supported the writing and development process but did not determine the final decisions or analyses.


## Final thoughts
This project helped me learn how to turn fragmented signals into a clear story. I learned how to guide readers through a narrative and how to shape a story for a specific audience. I also learned that strong writing and clear design matter as much as the data. If I had more time, I would explore additional datasets and possibly add a timeline of PM bootcamps and creators, but the current story meets the goals of the assignment. Overall, the process helped me improve both my storytelling and my design thinking.
