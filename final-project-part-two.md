# Wireframes / storyboards

This story takes ideas from pudding.cool. Their work uses short sections, clear charts, and simple layouts. I wanted the same qualities in my own draft. The goal was to make a story that is easy to follow and steady in tone. Each section has one idea and one chart. The structure is a straight path from the rise of interest in Product Management, to the growth of prep programs, to the recent shift toward AI-focused PM roles.

I have created and hosted my storyboard here:  
[Click here to view!](https://storytelling-final-project.vercel.app/)

The draft follows this structure:

Section 0 — Title  
A title card that sets the theme: Product Management as a career that rose, peaked, and then shifted again.

Section 1 — Cold Open  
A short story about “Aisha,” a composite student. This gives readers a clear entry point before they see data.

Section 2 — Approach  
A short explanation of why I focus on search trends, community growth, and salary ranges instead of direct hiring data. It uses simple icons to show each data source.

Section 3 — Guessing Chart  
A line chart without labels. The reader can guess which line is “Software Engineer” and which is “Product Manager.”

Section 4 — Act I  
A labeled line chart showing interest in PM rising over time. A second chart shows how PM salaries compare to other tech roles.

Section 5 — Act II  
Three visual elements:  
• growth of the r/ProductManagement subreddit  
• a timeline of PM bootcamps and interview prep sites  
• a bar chart that shows what people search for when they look up PM topics  
This part explains how an education market formed around PM.

Section 6 — Act III  
A line chart showing the dip in “Product Manager” searches and the rise in “AI Product Manager.”  
A bump chart showing how AI PM roles moved up in job rankings.  
A simple pay comparison for PM and AI PM roles.

Section 7 — Conclusion  
A short return to Aisha. This section explains how PM did not disappear but changed shape.

Section 8 — Methods  
A plain-language summary of data sources. Final data and sources will be added in Part III.

# User research 

## Target audience

The audience is CMU students who think about Product Management or who are near that field. This includes:

Heinz College students in the MISM, MISM-BIDA, and MSISPM programs.  
Tepper students in the MSPM and MBA programs.

These students experience both the PM hype and the shift toward AI roles. They understand the context and can give clear feedback. I chose interviewees based on interest in PM and a mix of technical and business backgrounds. I did not collect any personal information.

## Interview script

Goals:  
1. Check if the story path makes sense.  
2. See if the charts communicate the intended point.  
3. Find parts that confuse or slow the reader.  
4. See if the scrollytelling format helps.  
5. Gather suggestions for changes in Part III.

Questions used:

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Story clarity | What is the main point you take from this section? |
| Chart clarity | Does this chart help you understand the idea? |
| Confusion | Is anything unclear? |
| Flow | Does the story move in a smooth way? |
| Changes | What would you change before the final version? |

Full script:

Warm-up  
• Tell me your background and your interest in PM.  
• Have you felt the PM hype cycle online or in class?

Storyboard walkthrough  
For each chart or section:  
• What message do you get from this?  
• Does this chart make sense?  
• Would a different chart type help?  
• Does the transition into this section feel natural?

Wrap-up  
• Does the whole story make sense from start to end?  
• Where did it feel strong or weak?  
• Would you read something like this on pudding.cool?

## Interview findings

I interviewed four CMU graduate students. All descriptions are general.

Interviewee 1: Heinz MISM, technical background, mid-twenties  
Interviewee 2: Tepper MSPM, strategy background, late-twenties  
Interviewee 3: Heinz MISM-BIDA, analytics background, early-twenties  
Interviewee 4: Tepper MBA/MSPM, product strategy interest, late-twenties

Summary table:

| Questions | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Act I takeaway | Liked intro; salary jump was sharp | Wanted hiring context | Wanted note about placeholder data |
| Act II clarity | Subreddit chart felt real | Bootcamp timeline stood out | Said Act II was strongest |
| Act III clarity | Wanted clearer 2022 context | Bump chart was clear; rank label unclear | Wanted a hiring chart |
| Chart clarity | Asked for more labels | Asked for more annotations | Asked for data transparency |
| Improvements | Add short captions | Strengthen pivot into Act III | Add PM vs AI PM job postings chart |

Cross-interview insights:

What worked:  
• The guessing chart drew attention.  
• Act II felt clear and believable.  
• The bump chart was easy to read.  
• The tone felt clear and calm.

What needs change:  
• Charts need more labels.  
• Act III needs more detail.  
• Some transitions feel sudden.  
• Data sources need more clarity.

There were some differences in taste. Some wanted a stronger ending, others liked a quiet ending. Some wanted more technical detail, others wanted less.

# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis | Anticipated changes for Part III |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Salary transition felt sharp | Add a short line to bridge hype and pay |
| Weak transitions | Add simple text transitions between acts |
| Act III too light | Add chart of PM vs AI PM job postings |
| AI spike unclear | Add a short note about ChatGPT and layoffs |
| Placeholder data unclear | Add clear draft labels and stronger methods |
| Bump chart ambiguity | Explain how ranking works |
| Need more trust | Add screenshots of sources and cleaned data |

Final thoughts:

The research showed the structure works. The main improvements involve adding clarity. I will refine annotations, add one more chart in Act III, improve transitions, and strengthen the methods section with real data.

# Moodboards / personas

Persona 1 — Aspiring technical PM  
A Heinz student who wants a clear and honest view of PM. Wants fewer buzzwords and more real signals.

Persona 2 — Strategy-to-PM pivot  
A Tepper student who wants to know if PM is still a good move in the AI era.

## AI acknowledgements

I used AI to help organize the wireframes, shape the research protocol, and summarize interview findings. I wrote the story structure, interpretation, and final decisions myself.
