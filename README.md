# Naynika Wason: Telling Stories with Data Portfolio

This repository hosts my work and projects for the Telling Stories with Data course at Carnegie Mellon University.

## About me

Hey there. I'm Naynika, a graduate student at CMU in the Master of Information Systems Management (MISM) program. My background is in Computer Science, but my real passion is for building products that solve tangible problems.

Before coming to CMU, I spent two years at Adobe as an analytics consultant. My job was to help major clients—like Amazon, Samsung, and Asics—dig through their data to understand their users. I built a lot of reporting dashboards and saw firsthand how powerful a good visualization can be. I also realized how often that power is wasted with confusing charts or metrics that don't actually matter. Alongside my work, I've co-founded a couple of startups (Pitara and Peekly), which has solidified my belief that clear, actionable data is the foundation of any good product.

## What I hope to learn

My goal after graduation is to go back into product management or continue building my own ventures. In both roles, the job is often the same: you have to convince people to act. You're constantly translating complex information—user telemetry, A/B test results, market analysis—for engineers, designers, and leadership.

I'm in this class to learn how to bridge the gap between raw data and a compelling call to action. I want to move beyond just *reporting* metrics and learn to *tell stories* with them. I'm hoping to get better at creating visualizations that are not only accurate and clear, but also persuasive and human-centric.

## Portfolio
